## Information on the code

#### 2_solitary_wave_analytical
Initial analytical solution for the model. Is used to generate the boundary conditions for the xBeach model

NOTE: In wbctype = ts_nonh mode, the surface elevation input is the pertubation from the zs0 value. It is not the actual surface elevation.

#### 3_solitary_wave_compare_analy_xBeach
Compares the analytical solution to the xBeach model.
