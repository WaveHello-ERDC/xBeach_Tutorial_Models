NOTE: Running the post analysis requires the xBeach-toolbox. This can be installed using pip or stored locally and called (This is how it's done currently). At this time the setup.py file isn't implemented.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to have tutorial models available to learn the functionalities of xBeach and the python xBeach-toolbox. 
To accomplish some of the validation tests in the xBeach manuals are recreated here. The xBeach solution is compared with a baseline
solution when applicable.
